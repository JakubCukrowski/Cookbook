The idea for this project was born once I started going to the gym and basically didn't know what to eat. The project uses Firebase, Firestore, and Storage to create accounts, store user and recipe data, and enable the addition of photos.

Current features include:

Creating an account <b></b>
Uploading user photos (the website checks if the file is actually an image file) <b></b>
Adding recipes <b></b>
Liking recipes <b></b>
Storing recipes in a user's dashboard under 'liked' and 'created' <b></b>
Searching for a recipe <b></b>
Advanced search filters <b></b>

To be added: 

Commenting on recipes <b></b>
Deleting recipes <b></b>
Updating recipes <b></b>
Handling <hero /> component buttons for the most popular categories <b></b>
The ability to change email addresses <b></b>
Including special characters when creating a password <b></b>
Adding the possibility to view all recipes added by the user once on the single recipe page <b></b>
