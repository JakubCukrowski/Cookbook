The idea for this project was born once I started going to the gym and basically didn't know what to eat. The project uses Firebase, Firestore, and Storage to create accounts, store user and recipe data, and enable the addition of photos.

Current features include:

Creating an account
Uploading user photos (the website checks if the file is actually an image file)
Adding recipes
Liking recipes
Storing recipes in a user's dashboard under 'liked' and 'created'
Searching for a recipe
Advanced search filters
To be added:

Commenting on recipes
Deleting recipes
Updating recipes
Handling <hero /> component buttons for the most popular categories
The ability to change email addresses
Including special characters when creating a password
Adding the possibility to view all recipes added by the user once on the single recipe page
